            Are your attempts to find love via online dating leaving you frustrated? Confused? Even hopeless? If so, take heart and know that you're not alone! Many online daters are having experiences similar to yours and are not sure what to do differently.

          <p>
            Please change the first sentence in the next paragraph so it'll read: As a Licensed Therapist, Couples Counselor, Dating Coach and Survivor of Online Dating myself, I am here to help! For I specialize in romantic or intimate relationships and my work as a Couples Counselor informs my work as a Dating Coach and vice versa. This means that I rely on the Gottman Institute's forty years of research focused on identifying what all healthy and happy marriages/relationships have in common, what typically causes both marital and relationship breakdown and the "antidotes" to those causes.

      <p>
        In order to begin our work together, I first need to get to know you! So, prior to meeting, I will send you a pre-consultation questionnaire. Based off of your answers to that questionnaire, I will then write your online dating profile. We will then schedule a safe and convenient/commute-free 1.5 hour telehealth session via Doxy.com, allowing me to explain why I've structured your profile the way I have in order to both market and protect you online. We'll also discuss both my photo recommendations and, just as importantly, the best and evidence-based approach to take to online dating. If interested, you are then welcome to schedule additional coaching sessions once youâ€™ve uploaded your profile.

        <strong>Counseling Sessions</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Unlike most Dating Coaches, I am also a Licensed Therapist and Certified Couples Counselor. And having worked with single, married, divorced and widowed clients, I recognize that EVERYONE brings their own unique issues to dating, relationships, marriage & divorce. So please reach out today to educate the self on the self - always crucial when seeking & working toward lasting love!
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        If interested, we can then continue to meet for weekly 50 minute sessions to focus on the work that comes with "riding the roller coaster" that is online dating. For not only are you dealing with the thrill of raised expectations that comes with meeting or even just communicating with someone new, you're also dealing with the dashed hopes that comes with realizing that person isn't for you after all. And you're feeling the impact of that emotional roller coaster again and again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So in order to make dating less taxing and more rewarding, we will discuss how to put your best foot forward throughout the process - by, among other things, not only considering/adjusting your expectations but by also learning how to enjoy the life you're living right now.
      </p> -->

        * All clients, regardless of your gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion or age, are welcome.

          <p>
            Several years ago, pre-marriage and when I was still dating via online sites, a friend and I took a roughly 6 mile hike together. As I hadn't seen this friend in a while, I was excited to catch up and hear about any new developments in her life.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, while returning home, I realized that despite having families, friends, "fur babies" and careers, we'd spent our entire hike discussing nothing but our failed attempts to meet "the one" via online dating. Of course, this drove home just how frustrated we both were as we seemed to face dating disappointment after disappointment, but it also made me curious. What were we doing wrong? Why were we attracting the people we were? And why did it never seem to go anywhere? 
          </p>
          <p>
            These questions led to more questions, and in a search for answers, more reading about the subject of online dating, and what not only sparks but creates lasting relationships and marriages. This research promoted a change in my approach and, soon enough, I met the man of my dreams and now husband.
          </p>
          <p>     
            Now, as both a Couples Counselor and Dating Coach, I help my clients find their own happiness. For while I firmly believe that we should all be flexible, I also believe that we should also never settle or give up on love!

              Cybil is warm, empathetic, caring and effective and my work with her has had amazing results for me. Finding a partner has been a trial and error process for me. Before Cybil's guidance, I was blindly hitting walls, being ghosted and using ineffective approaches. Now I feel empowered, calm and excited about online dating.

              I highly recommend Cybil's services to anyone who is navigating online dating. The entire process from start to finish was extremely easy. After answering Cybil's questionnaire, she wrote a dating profile that I absolutely love as it really captured who I am and the kind of partner I'm looking for while also setting boundaries to prevent others from wasting my time. What's more, I had been doing online dating (unsuccessfully) for about 4 years and my consultation with Cybil made me recognize the ways in which I'd been an ineffective dater. I will now be using Cybil's approach in order to become an effective one. In short, Cybil provides a wonderful service; I just wish I'd found her sooner!

              Since working with Cybil, I feel much stronger, & more confident as I have been able to process the impact of a toxic relationship before learning how to let it go. She has also helped me set up an online profile and has given me great tips to begin the online dating journey. I am so grateful to be working with her!
