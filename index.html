            Are your attempts to find love via online dating leaving you frustrated? Confused? Even hopeless? If so, take heart and know that you're not alone! Many online daters are having experiences similar to yours and are not sure what to do differently. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As both a licensed therapist and survivor of online dating, I am here to help! For, in addition to being able to offer experienced counseling services, I am eager to share what years (yes, years!) of online dating taught me.

      <p>
        We will begin by meeting for a session aimed at helping you identify what you put the most value on in a prospective partner and why. We will then review and/or create your profile and photos in an effort to attract the kind of partner you actually want to date. Lastly, we will develop strategies to give you a sense of how much (or how little) to communicate when either reaching out to or responding to potential partners.
      </p>

      <h4 class="card-title font-italic">
        <strong>Ongoing Weekly Sessions</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        If interested, we can then continue to meet for weekly 50 minute sessions to focus on the work that comes with "riding the roller coaster" that is online dating. For not only are you dealing with the thrill of raised expectations that comes with meeting or even just communicating with someone new, you're also dealing with the dashed hopes that comes with realizing that person isn't for you after all. And you're feeling the impact of that emotional roller coaster again and again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So in order to make dating less taxing and more rewarding, we will discuss how to put your best foot forward throughout the process - by, among other things, not only considering/adjusting your expectations but by also learning how to enjoy the life you're living right now.

          <p>
            Several years ago, pre-marriage and when I was still dating via online sites, a friend and I took a roughly 6 mile hike together. As I hadn't seen this friend in a while, I was excited to catch up and hear about any new developments in her life.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, while returning home, I realized that despite having families, friends, "fur babies" and careers, we'd spent our entire hike discussing nothing but our failed attempts to meet "the one" via online dating. Of course, this drove home just how frustrated we both were as we seemed to face dating disappointment after disappointment, but it also made me curious. What were we doing wrong? Why were we attracting the people we were? And why did it never seem to go anywhere? 
          </p>
          <p>
            These questions led to more questions, and in a search for answers, more reading about the subject of online dating, and what not only sparks but creates lasting relationships and marriages. This research ultimately prompted a change in my approach to online dating and, soon enough, I attracted the man of my dreams and married him just a year later. 
          </p>
          <p>     
            Now, as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who pairs Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Meditation and Mindfulness techniques to help clients combat symptoms of both depression and anxiety, I help clients find their own happiness. For I firmly believe that while we should all be flexible, we should also never settle or give up on love!

              Cybil is warm, empathetic, caring and effective and my work with her has had amazing results for me. Finding a partner has been a trial and error process for me. Before Cybil's guidance, I was blindly hitting walls, being ghosted and using ineffective approaches. Now I feel empowered, calm and excited about online dating.
